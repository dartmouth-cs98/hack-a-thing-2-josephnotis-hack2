# CS 98 Hack-a-thing 2
## Joseph Notis, Fall 2020

### What I attempted to build

I built a Chrome extension that follows the ["Getting Started" tutorial from Google](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted). 
This extension takes a webpage from developer.chrome.com and changes it to either green, blue, yellow, or red based on the user's setting.

### Who did what

I worked on this hack-a-thing alone.

### What I learned

In the Getting Started Tutorial

### How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?

My group is looking into building a Chrome extension that analyzes what data is collected on social media. 
This tutorial provides me with the basic framework of how a chrome extension works.

### What didnâ€™t work

So far, nothing!
